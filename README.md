# Stork Editor
(formerly known as Parasol Editor)

After reverse engineering a portion of Yoshi's Island DS, I wanted to have something to show for it. So I created Stork Editor, a graphic level editor for the game.

It currently has visuals working, as well as loading 90% of levels successfully. Much of this is still in the reverse engineering phase.
