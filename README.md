# parasol-editor

After reverse engineering a portion of Yoshi's Island DS, I wanted to have something to show for it. So I created Parasol Editor, a graphic level editor for the game. It currently has visuals working, as well as loading 90% of levels successfully. Much of this is still in the engineering phase though, I just thought I'd make the repo public to show off my work thus far.
