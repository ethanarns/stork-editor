# Stork Editor
(formerly known as Parasol Editor)

After reverse engineering a portion of Yoshi's Island DS, I wanted to have something to show for it. So I created Stork Editor, a graphic level editor for the game.

It currently has visuals working, as well as loading 90% of levels successfully. Much of this is still in the reverse engineering phase.

It uses the USA version 1.0. Do NOT use 1.1 or "rev 1." SHA256 Sum: c75bf32c31f7b5f02c4ed08102c421d243cfb3226d4f89d2819e645b531f6507
